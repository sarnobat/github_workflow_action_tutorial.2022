# github_workflow_action_tutorial
Autobuild golang binaries

The one that does the job is:
```
release.yml
```
I can't trigger it successfully if I press the "Run workflow" button. I need to create a release on the right hand side, then the action completes without an http upload error.

### TODO
* 2024-01: Create a native binary of google java formatter using GraalVM for Intel & M1 architecture (maybe Linux too)
